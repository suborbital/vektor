# Vektor has been deprecated. It is being absorbed into the [E2 Core repo](https://github.com/suborbital/e2core). No further releases will be published in this project.

# The Vektor Guide ðŸ—º

Vektor's goal is to help you develop web services faster. Vektor handles much of the boilerplate needed to start building a Go server, so you can serve a request in less than 10 lines of code:
```golang
import "github.com/suborbital/vektor/vk"

server := vk.New(vk.UseAppName("Vektor API Server"), vk.UseDomain("vektor.example.com"))

server.GET("/ping", HandlePing)

if err := server.Start(); err != nil {
	log.Fatal(err)
}

func HandlePing(r *http.Request, ctx *vk.Ctx) (interface{}, error) {
	return "pong", nil
}
```
Those are the basics, but Vektor is capable of scaling up to serve powerful production workloads, using its full suite of API-oriented features.

# Set up `vk`

## The server object

The `vk.Server` type contains everything needed to build a web service. It includes the router, a middleware system, customizable plug-in points, and handy built-in components like LetsEncrypt support and CORS handlers.

Creating a server object is done with `vk.New()` and accepts an optional list of `OptionModifiers` which allow customization of the server:
```golang
server := vk.New(
	vk.UseAppName("Vektor API Server"),
	vk.UseDomain("vektor.example.com"),
)
```

To create a server object without TLS support, omit the `vk.UseDomain()` modifier and specify an HTTP port to listen on.
```golang
server := vk.New(
	vk.UseAppName("Vektor API HTTP-only"),
	vk.UseHTTPPort(8000),
)
```

The included `OptionsModifiers` are:

Option | Description | ENV key
--- | --- | ---
UseDomain(domain string) | Enable LetsEncrypt support with the provided domain name (will serve on :80 and :443 for challenge server and API server). LetsEncrypt is disabled by default. | `VK_DOMAIN`
UseTLSConfig(config *tls.Config) | Enable TLS and use the provided TLS config to serve HTTPS. This will override the `domain` option. | N/A
UseTLSPort(port int) | Choose an HTTPS port on which to serve requests. | `VK_TLS_PORT`
UseHTTPPort(port int) | Choose an HTTP port on which to serve requests. When using TLS, the LetsEncrypt challenge server will run on the configured HTTP port. | `VK_HTTP_PORT`
UseAppName(name string) | When the application starts, `name` will be logged. Empty by default. | `VK_APP_NAME`
UseEnvPrefix(prefix string) | Use `prefix` instead of `VK` for environment variables, for example `APP_HTTP_PORT` instead of `VK_HTTP_PORT`. | N/A
UseLogger(logger *vlog.Logger) | Set the logger object to be used. The logger is used internally by `vk` and is available to all handler functions via the `ctx` object. If this option is not passed, `vlog.Default` is used, and its environment variable prefix set to the same as vk's. (`VK` by default). | N/A

Each of the options can be set using the modifier function, or by setting the associated environment variable. The environment variable will override the modifier function.

> Note the use of `UseEnvPrefix` if you would prefer to use something other than `VK` for your environment variables!

## Handler functions

`vk`'s handler function definition is:
```golang
func HandlePing(r *http.Request, ctx *vk.Ctx) (interface{}, error)
```
Here's a breakdown of each part:

`r *http.Request`: The request object for the request being handled.

`ctx *vk.Ctx`: A context object containing more options for interacting with the request. See more below.

`(interface{}, error)`: The return types of the handler allow you to respond to HTTP requests by simply returning values. If an error is returned, `vk` will interpret it as a failed request and respond with an error code, if error is `nil`, then the `interface{}` value is used to respond based on the response handling rules. **Responding to requests is handled in depth below in [Responding to requests](#responding-to-requests)**


## Mounting routes

To define routes for your `vk` server, use the HTTP method functions on the server object:
```golang
server := vk.New(
	vk.UseAppName("Vektor API Server"),
	vk.UseDomain("vektor.example.com"),
)

server.GET("/users", HandleGetUsers)
server.POST("/groups", HandleCreateGroup)
```
If you prefer to pass the HTTP method as an argument, use `server.Handle()` instead.

**Note that attempting to add new handlers after calling `server.Start()` is a no-op**

## Route groups

`vk` allows grouping routes by a common path prefix. For example, if you want a group of routes to begin with the `/api/` path, you can create an API route group and then mount all of your handlers to that group.
```golang
apiGroup := vk.Group("/api")
apiGroup.GET("/events", HandleGetEvents)

server.AddGroup(apiGroup)
```
Calling `AddGroup` will calculate the full paths for all routes and mount them to the server. In the example above, the handler would be mounted at `/api/events`.

Groups can even be added to groups!
```golang
v1 := vk.Group("/v1")
v1.GET("/events", HandleEventsV1)

v2 := vk.Group("/v2")
v2.GET("/events", HandleEventsV2)

apiGroup := vk.Group("/api")
apiGroup.AddGroup(v1)
apiGroup.AddGroup(v2)

server.AddGroup(api)
```
This will create a natural grouping of your routes, with the above example creating the `/api/v1/events` and `/api/v2/events` routes.


## Middleware and Afterware

Groups become even more powerful when combined with Middleware and Afterware. Middleware are pseudo request handlers that run in sequence before the mounted `vk.HandlerFunc` is run. Middleware functions can modify a request and its context, or they can return an error, which causes the request handling to be terminated immediately. Two examples:
```golang
func headerMiddleware(r *http.Request, ctx *vk.Ctx) error {
	ctx.Headers.Set("X-Vektor-Test", "foobar")

	return nil
}

func denyMiddleware(r *http.Request, ctx *vk.Ctx) error {
	if strings.Contains(r.URL.Path, "hack") {
		ctx.Log.ErrorString("HACKER!!")

		return vk.E(403, "begone, hacker")
	}

	return nil
}
```
Middleware have a similar function signature to `vk.HandlerFunc`, but only return an error. The first example modifies the request context to add a response header. The second example detects a hacker and returns an error, which is handled exactly like any other error response (see below). Returning an error from a Middleware prevents the request from ever reaching the registered handler.

Middleware are applied to route groups with the `Before` method:
```golang
v1 := vk.Group("/v1").Before(vk.ContentTypeMiddleware("application/json"), denyMiddleware, headerMiddleware)
v1.GET("/events", HandleEventsV1)
```
This example shows a group created with three middleware. The first adds the `Content-Type` response header (and is included with `vk`), the second and third are the examples from above. When the group is mounted to the server, the chain of middleware are put in place, and are run before the registered handler. When groups are nested, the middleware from the parent group are run before the middleware of any child groups. In the example of nested groups above, any middleware set on the `apiGroup` groups would run before any middleware set on the `v1` or `v2` groups.

Afterware is similar, but is run _after_ the request handler. Who knew! Afterware cannot modify response body or status code, but can modify response headers using the `ctx` object. Afterware will **always run**, even if something earlier in the request chain fails. Here's an example:

```golang
func logAfter(r *http.Request, ctx *vk.Ctx) {
	ctx.Log.Info("request completed")
}

v2 := vk.Group("/v2").Before(vk.ContentTypeMiddleware("application/json")).After(logAfter)
v2.GET("/events", HandleEventsV2)
```

Middleware and Afterware in `vk` is designed to be easily composable, creating chains of behaviour easily grouped to sets of routes. Middleware can also help increase security of applications, allowing authentication, request throttling, active defence, etc, to run before the registered handler and keeping sensitive code from even being reached in the case of an unauthorized request.


# Responding to requests

## Response types

`vk` includes two types, `Response` and `Error` (with helper functions `vk.Respond(...)` and `vk.Err(...)`) that can be used to gain extra control over the response code and contents that you want to return:

```golang
type createdResponse struct {
	Name string `json:"name"`
	UUID string `json:"uuid"`
}

func HandleCreate(r *http.Request, ctx *vk.Ctx) (interface{}, error) {
	// Do some work

	resp := createdResponse {
		Name: "Wendy",
		UUID: "jfioqerjhp98qergnjw98h23"
	}

	// Return 201 (Created) and JSON
	return vk.Respond(http.StatusCreated, resp), nil
}

func HandleDelete(r *http.Request, ctx *vk.Ctx) (interface{}, error) {
	// Oops, something went wrong

	return nil, vk.Err(http.StatusConflict, "the user is already deleted") // responds with HTTP status 409 and body {"status": 409, "message": "the user is already deleted"}
}
```
`vk.Respond` and `vk.Err` can be used with their shortcuts `vk.R` and `vk.E` if you like your code to be terse.

## Response handling rules

`vk` processes the `(interface{}, error)` returned by handler functions in a specific way to ensure you always know how it will behave while still being able to use simple types in your code.

### Successful responses (i.e. the `interface{}` returned by handler functions):

`vk.Response` is an (optional) type that can be used to control the behaviour of the response, if desired. `vk.Respond(...)` returns a `vk.Response`.

1. If the type is `vk.Response`, set the HTTP status code provided and process `Response.body` as follows. (If the type is NOT `vk.Response`, the status code is set to `200 OK`)
1. If the type is string, write the string (as UTF-8 bytes) to the response body.
1. If the type is bytes, write them directly to the response body.
1. If the type is a struct, attempt to marshal to JSON and write JSON bytes to the response body.

If a Content-Type is not explicitly set by your code in the middleware chain or `HandlerFunc`, the value will be inferred from the type returned from the `HandlerFunc`.

Examples:

Handler returns... | Status Code | Response body | Content-Type
--- | --- | --- | ---
`return "Hello, World", nil` | 200 OK | "Hello World" (as UTF-8 bytes) | `text/plain`
`return jsonBytesFromJSONMarshal, nil` | 200 OK | [JSON bytes as generated by json.Marshal] | `application/octet-stream`
`return someStructInstance, nil` | 200 OK | [JSON respresentation of struct automatically marshalled by `vk`] | `application/json`
`return vk.R(http.StatusCreated, "created"), nil` | 201 Created | "created" (as UTF-8 bytes) | `text/plain`
`return vk.R(http.StatusCreated, someStructInstance), nil` | 201 Created | [JSON respresentation of struct automatically marshalled by `vk`] | `application/json`

### Failure responses (i.e. the `error` returned by middleware or handler functions):

`vk.Error` is an interface that can be used to control the behaviour of error responses. `vk.ErrorResponse` is a concrete type that implements `vk.Error`. Any errors that do NOT implement `vk.Error` will be treated as potentially unsafe, and their contents will be logged but not returned to the caller. Use `vk.Wrap(...)` if you'd like to wrap an `error` in `vk.ErrorResponse`. `vk.Err` returns a `vk.Error`.

`vk.Error` looks like this:
```golang
type Error interface {
	Error() string // this ensures all Errors will also conform to the normal error interface

	Message() string
	Status() int
}
```

Errors returned from middleware or `HandlerFunc`s are handled as follows:

1. If the type is `vk.Error`, set the HTTP status code provided and respond with JSON as follows: `{"status": err.Status(), "message": err.Message()}`
2. If the type is NOT `vk.Error`, log the potentially unsafe error contents, set the HTTP status code to 500, and respond with "Internal Server Error"

Examples:

Handler returns... | Status Code | Response body | Content-Type
--- | --- | --- | ---
`return nil, errors.New("failed to add user")` | 500 Internal Server Error | "Internal Server Error" (as UTF-8 bytes) | `text/plain`
`return nil, vk.E(http.StatusForbidden, "not permitted to do this thing")` | 403 Forbidden | `{"status": 403, "message": "not permitted to do this thing"}` | `application/json`
`return nil, vk.Wrap(http.StatusApplicationError, err)` | 434 Application Error | `{"status": 434, "message": err.Error()}` | `application/json`

## Standard http.HandlerFunc
`vk` can use standard `http.HandlerFunc` handlers by mounting them with `server.HandleHTTP`. This is useful for mounting handler functions provided by third party libraries (such as Prometheus), but they are not able to take advantage of many `vk` features such as middleware or route groups currently.

## The Ctx Object
Each request handler is passed a `vk.Ctx` object, which is a context object for the request. It is similar to the `context.Context` type (and uses one under the hood), but `Ctx` has been augmented for use in web service development.

`Ctx` includes a standard Go `context.Context` which can be used as a pseudo key/value store using `ctx.Set()` and `ctx.Get()`. This allows passing things into request handlers such as database connections or other persistent objects. Middleware and Afterware can access the `Ctx` to modify it, or access data from it.

The server's configured `vlog.Logger` object is included (`ctx.Log`) for logging within request handlers, and a shortcut for setting the logger's scope for the current request exists with `ctx.UseScope(...)`. You can learn about scope in [the vlog docs](../vlog/README.md). A default scope will always be set with the request ID included.

Accessing the URL params for the request (such as `/users/:uuid`) is done with `ctx.Params`, and `ctx.RespHeaders` can be used to set response headers if needed.

`Ctx` can also be used to easily get a request ID, with `ctx.RequestID()`. The Request ID is generated and cached on the object, and so calling it multiple times will return the same value. If you prefer to set your own Request ID, `ctx.UseRequestID()` will do the trick, however it will mean the first log message for the request will have a different ID as it uses the default ID generated for the `ctx`.
